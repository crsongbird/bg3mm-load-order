# Load Order .JSON for BG3MM

First install the [collection on the nexus](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/bml65n/). I use Vortex, but you have to set up vortex correctly or else it will bonk your mods list. Don't use it's builtin LSLIB, instead use bgmm to manage the load order.

### How to set up the correct load order:

- Download the File from the releases tab.
- Extract the .json file.
- Import the file with BG3MM and then export it (ctrl+e) to your game.
